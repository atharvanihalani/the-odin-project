Layout
- background fuzzy image (vibe – enter da backstage)
    - subtle border effects?
- submit button
    - button appears grey-ed ('yellow-ed'?) out if all entries not filled up; saturated color when valid
    - crackly energy effect on button hover
    - if valid entries, bright flash of white light + slowly fade to confirmation screen

WRAP IN DIV and add sign when input is invalid (using :before/:after)
crackly energy effect on button hover??
BH logo "crackles on" when all valid??
animated looping background – streaks of yellow flying out??
